### Hi there, I'm Riski! 👋

I'm a Full Stack Developer with 5+ years of experience passionate about building fast, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. With expertise in [ReactJS](https://react.dev/), [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/), [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org/), [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), I specialize in crafting high-performance interfaces that enhance user experience and business growth. I currently work as a Senior Front-End Developer at a software company in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia.

### 👨🏻‍💻 What i do

I love turning ideas into reality. My journey in web and mobile app development with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) has led me to work on a variety of projects, from simple landing page application (SPA) to complex web applications. Whether I'm coding solo or collaborating with a team, I enjoy building interactive and user-friendly applications of course, by applying the concept of white clean, efficient, and maintainable code. Here you'll find a collection some of [my works](https://github.com/hiriski?tab=repositories), contributions, and maybe a few random thoughts😄, I hope to make a big footprint.

...oh there is one more thing, as a role as Front-end developer I also aware about design I like to create clean and modern graphic designs with Adobe Photoshop & Corel Draw, & Figma just to complete the visual design in my apps and github profile.
